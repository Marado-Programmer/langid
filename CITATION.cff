  This paper goes through the basics of supervised machine learning while
  simultaneously I implement with code what I'm learning without the use of
  libraries that hide what's really happening underneath and don't allow us to
  really understand and learn.
  I'm writing this paper because of school. But still, this is a topic I would
  like to really understand.
  Because now AI in general has become main stream it feels like that what
  already seemed like a black box for me, it has become even more abstracted
  away, so the average person can make use of these technologies.
  During my last internship (January to March 2023) there was a time I had to
  do some audio recognition stuff that I remember used tensorflow, the ML
  library for JavaScript, under the hood.
  Good for me that there was an interface for the things I needed to implement,
  but if the guy that was giving me tasks had an idea in which those interfaces
  couldn't help, I would not know what to do.
  I know what I learned doing this project it's just the surface, but it's this
  foundation that I need to start learning more complex ideas.
